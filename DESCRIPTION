Description: Provides tools for applying Krippendorff's Alpha methodology <DOI:10.1080/19312450709336664>. Both the customary methodology and Hughes' methodology <DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2210.13265> are supported, the former being preferred for larger datasets, the latter for smaller datasets. The framework supports common and user-defined distance functions, and can accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and missingness. Interval estimation can be done in parallel for either methodology.
